# 🎯 Natac Development Plan

## High-Level Strategic Roadmap

### 🏗️ **Phase 1: Complete Core Game Engine** (2-3 weeks)
**Status**: 🟡 In Progress

**Objectives:**
- ✅ Core Objects: Hex, Vertex, Edge, NumberToken, Player, GamePieces
- 🔄 Board Object - Manages hex grid, generates standard Catan layout
- 🔄 Game Rules Engine - Turn management, win conditions, trading rules
- ⏳ AI Logic - Simple bots for testing (optional but helpful)
- ⏳ Unit Tests - Comprehensive testing of all game mechanics

**Goal**: Bulletproof game logic that enforces all Catan rules correctly

### 🎮 **Phase 2: Build Interactive 3D Board** (2-3 weeks)
**Status**: ⏳ Pending

**Objectives:**
- 3D Renderer - Clean separation between objects and Three.js visualization
- Click Interactions - Place settlements/cities/roads with mouse
- Camera System - Smooth controls, multiple view angles
- Visual Polish - Materials, lighting, animations, particle effects

**Goal**: Beautiful, responsive 3D interface that's fun to interact with

### ⚖️ **Phase 3: Implement Full Game Rules** (2-3 weeks)
**Status**: ⏳ Pending

**Objectives:**
- Complete Ruleset - Resource production, development cards, special rules
- Game Flow - Setup phase, turn phases, end game conditions
- Trading System - Player-to-player trades, bank trades, ports
- Edge Cases - Robber mechanics, longest road/largest army

**Goal**: 100% accurate Catan implementation following official rules

### 🌐 **Phase 4: Add Multiplayer & Real-time Sync** (2-3 weeks)
**Status**: ⏳ Pending

**Objectives:**
- Room System - Create/join games, spectator mode
- State Synchronization - Keep all players in sync via Socket.IO
- Reconnection - Handle disconnects gracefully
- Game Persistence - Save/resume games

**Goal**: Stable 4-player online experience with no desync issues

### 🎨 **Phase 5: Polish UI/UX & Game Flow** (2-3 weeks)
**Status**: ⏳ Pending

**Objectives:**
- Game Lobby - Player matching, game options, chat
- HUD/Interface - Resource cards, development cards, player stats
- Animations - Dice rolling, piece placement, resource collection
- Sound Effects - Ambient sounds, action feedback

**Goal**: Professional game feel that rivals commercial board game apps

### 🚀 **Phase 6: Add Advanced Features** (Ongoing)
**Status**: ⏳ Future

**Objectives:**
- Game Variants - Different board layouts, house rules
- Tournament Mode - Ranked play, leaderboards, statistics
- Spectator Features - Watch games, replay system
- Mobile Support - Responsive design, touch controls

**Goal**: Feature-rich platform that keeps players engaged long-term

### ☁️ **Phase 7: Deploy & Scale** (1-2 weeks)
**Status**: ⏳ Future

**Objectives:**
- Production Deployment - Docker, cloud hosting, CDN
- Performance Optimization - Code splitting, asset optimization
- Monitoring - Error tracking, analytics, performance metrics
- Documentation - API docs, deployment guides

**Goal**: Scalable production system that can handle hundreds of concurrent games

## 🎯 Current Focus (Phase 1)

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Complete Board Object** - Generate proper hex grid with vertices/edges
2. **Basic Game Object** - Turn management and rule enforcement
3. **Simple 3D Renderer** - Visualize our object system in Three.js

### Architecture Principles:
- **Object-Oriented Design** - Everything is a clean, debuggable object
- **Separation of Concerns** - Game logic separate from rendering
- **First Principles** - Built from ground up with proper foundations
- **Easy Debugging** - Every object has inspection methods

### Current Status:
- ✅ Hex coordinate system explained and tested
- ✅ Core objects: Hex, Vertex, Edge, NumberToken, GamePieces, Player
- ✅ Interactive test suite for object inspection
- 🔄 Next: Board object to manage hex grid relationships
